In 2022, I obtained M.S. degree at the [National Engineering Research Center of Visual Technology (NELVT)](http://idm.pku.edu.cn/en/), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), supervised by Prof. [Ling-Yu Duan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hsXZOgIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). In 2019, I obtained my B.E. degree in software engineering from [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/main.htm).


My current research focuses on computer vision and autonomous driving, especially metric learning, object re-identification, and scene understanding.
